### This folder contains the scripts for pairwise repression comparison between different cell lines and sgRNA delivery methods. The sgRNA library is CMPilot. 
* Repression_efficiency_compare.ipynb: compare the promoter and enhancer repression efficiency across 6 experiments (CMPilot). 
* 4-1WTC11_H9_PB9_correlation.ipynb: pariwise comparison of WTC11-PB9 vs H9-PB9
* 4-2H9_PB9_inducible_correlation.ipynb: pariwise comparison of H9-PB9 vs H9(inducible)-lenti
* 4-3H9_PB9_lenti_correlation.ipynb: pariwise comparison of H9-PB9 vs H9-lenti
* 4-4WTC11_PB9_lenti_correlation.ipynb: pariwise comparison of WTC11-PB9 vs WTC11-lenti
* 4-5WTC11_PB9_recombinase_correlation.ipynb: pariwise comparison of WTC11-PB9 vs WTC11-recombinase
